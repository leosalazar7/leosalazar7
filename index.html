            About this site:
        </b>
        <ul>
            I designed this website to look like my favorite Computer Science teacher's website, Arup Guha.
            I always thought it was funny how simple the site looked like being made entirely out of HTML/CSS.
            Being as it was just a medium for sharing content and resources related to the class, it didn't need to be more.
            Regardless of how it looks, the site is straightforward and functional.
